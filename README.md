# GradientGames
Gradient Games: High-performance stress test for next-gen optimizers. Moving beyond AdamW, we benchmark Matrix-Aware (Muon), Variance-Reduced (MARS), and Sign-based (Lion) methods. This suite evaluates spectral health, rank collapse, and the Pareto frontier of accuracy vs. wall-clock time across Transformers and CNNs. The future of SOTA training.
